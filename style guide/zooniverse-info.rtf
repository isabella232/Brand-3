\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 What is the Zooniverse?
\b0 \
The Zooniverse is the world\'92s largest and most popular platform for people-powered research.

Our goal is to enable research that would not be possible, or practical, otherwise. Zooniverse research results in new discoveries, datasets useful to the wider research community, and\'a0many publications ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.zooniverse.org/about/publications"}}{\fldrslt https://www.zooniverse.org/about/publications}}) .\
